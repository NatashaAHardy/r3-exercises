Like branches of a tree.

**Key Steps**

- [Ben Best's tutorial page](https://noaa-iea.github.io/r3-train/collaborate.html)

- Work from your rmd-website local forked branch

- Make sure your _site.yml doc reflects the pages and parameters you need

```{r example yml code, eval=FALSE}

name: "R<sup>3</sup>"
navbar:
  title: "R<sup>3</sup> Exercises"
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "Collaborate"
      href: collaborate.html
output_dir: "."

```

- Make sure each document (here "index.html" and "collaborate.html" exist in the "docs" which you setup as your website directory)

- rmarkdown::render_site()

- In my case, move everything but the .rmd files into "/docs"

- Commit and push changes

- Go to project's [GitHub R3 exercises](https://github.com/NatashaAHardy/r3-exercises) to check all the files are in order

- Go to 'main' local branch, and in Terminal shell git merge rmd-website

- In 'main' commit and push changes

- These should propapage to your website.
